  Hi, My name is <b>Michał<b>. I'm currently working as an RPA Designer at Linklaters, automating processes for Business Teams via VBA / PowerAutomate / BluePrism / Powershell  / R. On a day-to-day basis, I'm learning and developing solutions in Python / Powershell / C# / Dart for my personal use. Aside from programming, I'm also a frequent gym-goer to keep myself in check and push my body's strength goals and achievements.
